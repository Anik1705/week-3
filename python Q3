3) All of the variable names below can be used. But which of these is the better variable name to use?
A       a       Area      AREA        area      areaOfRectangle       AreaOfRectangle
We can eliminate “A” and “a” because they are not really meaningful.
It is better to start the variable with a lowercase letter, so eliminate “Area”, “AREA” and “AreaOfRectangle”.
Compared to “area” “areaOfRectangle” is more explicit. “areaOfRectangle” seems a better variable.


4) Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one might be wrong.)
apple      APPLE     Apple2        1Apple   account number          account_number       account.number    accountNumber       fred  Fred   return   return_value   5Return  GreatBigVariable   greatBigVariable   great_big_variable   great.big.variable  
Variable must begin with a letter so “1Apple”, “5Return” are not allowed.
“retune” is one of the reserved keywords of python.
There shouldn’t be any space or dot between the different characters of the variables like “account number”, “account.number”,
“great.big.value” “.
