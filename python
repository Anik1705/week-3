Week 3

1)	Write a program that asks for two numbers (Python has all the basic mathematical functions in place, like +,- etc.),
adds them up and displays the result. 

n1 = int(input("insert the first number"))
n2 = int(input("insert the second number"))
print (int(n1+n2))

2) Answer the questions by implementing the code and run it.
a)	What will the output be from the following code?
num = 4
num*=2
num1=num+2
num1+=3
print(num1)

num = 4
num*=2
num1=num+2
num1+=3
print(num1)
